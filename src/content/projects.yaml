    cuBIC participated actively in the development of the Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction Engine (PIPE) which
    was the first algorithm capable of generating the comprehensive human interactome. Today, PIPE is currently in its
    4th iteration, and we are continuously trying to improve its performance, and trying to apply it to elucidate new
    interactomes such as that of human-SARS-CoV-2 for example.

    Peptide inhibitor display outstanding specificity for their target, and as such, show great potential as therapeutics through
    disruption of protein-protein interactions and/or modulation of enzyme activity. Unfortunately, designing peptide inhibitors
    in the wet lab is labour and resource-intensive. Recent developments in *in silico* peptide design (e.g. InSiPS) have made
    it possible to generate active peptide therapeutics using only the primary sequence of the targeted protein as an input.
    Unfortunately, such methods are slow and have suboptimal convergence.<br/><br/>Consistent with our core belief that collaboration
    across discipline is vital in the modern era, we initiated a partnership with the Biggar lab (biology) to develop a new method
    that integrates wet lab experiments (eg. peptide arrays) with computational methods in an iterative fashion to improve the state of
    the art in *in silico* peptide design.

    We apply state of the art machine vision and pressure-sensitive mat (PSM) technologies to
    enable non-invasive monitoring of neonates in the NICU. As part of this research, conducted in
    collaboration with experts from the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO),
    we develop apply existing and develop novel algorithms to analyze terabytes of RGB-depth imagery, and PSM data. We are interested in a variety of applications within this realm, including heart rate and respiratory rate estimation, event detection, false alarm reduction, etc.

          The aim of this project is to develop a robust methodology to accurately 
          quantify, understand, and mitigate patient vibrations experienced during
          emergency transport of neonates to the NICU. To this end, we employ a range
          of instruments and techniques including shaker tables and digital signal processing.

          In collaboration with the RVR Lab, we apply cutting-edge maching learning techniques to monitor stress levels in patients
          undergoing virtual reality-based treatment with the CAREN system. This stress levels must be carefully monitored in order
          for the exercise to achieve a meaningful therapeutic
          benefit. If stress levels are too high, dissociation may occur, which can be detrimental. Using
          sensor data from various sources (respiration rate, heart rate, *etc.*), the system being developed aims to determine whether stimulation
          should be increased or reduced so as to remain in the optimal therapeutic regime.

    The Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB) receives a large number of claims
    related to occupational noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) every year. The delay between the reception
    of a claim and the final decision is long, and takes up to 6-8 months. In collaboration with
    the WSIB, we developed software to streamline the process. We developed a solution that
    digitizes audiological report (faxed images of low quality) to extract hearing thresholds from
    the audiograms in the report. Our solution then applies a series of rules to evaluate the eligibility
    of the claim and provides a preliminary decision.

    The rise of autonomous vehicles looms, and we anticipate that this will
    opens a wide range of opportunities for remote sensing. The sensors that
    will equip these vehicles will have the ability to collect and broadcast
    astronomical quantities of data. In this project, we aim to develop
    an algorithm capable of automatically extracting gas price data from gas
    signs as an alternative solution to applications such as [GasBuddy](https://www.gasbuddy.com/). To this
    end, we collect large amounts of street view imagery, and train machine learning
    algorithms to accurately detect gas prices in images and associate them with the correct
    gas grades and payment methods.
