    Dr. Green is a full professor in the Department of Systems and
    Computer Engineering at Carleton University. His research focuses
    on the application of machine learning to challenges in biomedical
    informatics, particularly in the presence of class imbalance.
    Current research projects include the prediction of protein
    structure, function, and interaction; the use of supervised and
    semi-supervised machine learning for the identification of
    microRNA in unique species; unobtrusive and non-contact neonatal
    patient monitoring; developing ML for audiology; applying computer
    vision to autonomous vehicle imagery; and the acceleration of
    scientific computing using parallel computing.

  thesis: Synthetic biology targeting lysine methylation
  background: Biochemistry, Chemical Engineering
  quote: Science knows no country, because knowledge belongs to humanity, and is the torch which illuminates the world. (Louis Pasteur)
  biography: |
    I am a computational biologist interested mainly in protein biochemistry. The main focus of my PhD thesis is to study
    how computational methods and laboratory experiments can complement each other to design peptide inhibitors. I am particularly interested
    in developing peptide inhibitors against lysine methyltransferases and demethylases, as lysine methylation is known to contribute to
    chemoresistance and proliferation of cancer cells. In my spare times, I enjoy songwriting and reading.

  background: Biology, Computer Science
  quote: The best way to have a good idea is to have a lot of ideas. (Linus Pauling)
  biography: |
    I am interested in leveraging computational methods and high-performance computing infrastructure to provide insight into complex 
    problems including the elucidation of protein-protein interactions and binding interfaces, analysis of autonomous vehicle-sensed 
    data, scientometrics, and the promotion of access to information. While my thesis is focused on the development of a novel
    semi-supervised machine learning method, as a polymath and solutionist, I am involved in a diverse array of research projects.
    I am passionate about scientific communication and am currently an executive editor of the Health Science Inquiry.

  thesis: Machine Vision and Deep Learning for Patient Monitoring in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit
  background: Mathematics, Biology, Biomedical Engineering
  quote: I heard a voice that told me I'm essential. How all my fears are limiting my potential. Said it's time to step into the light and use every bit of power I have inside. (India Arie)
  biography: |
    I am a person who is always eager to learn from different fields. I received the B. Sc. degree in Biology from Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada in 2014. I later completed the B. Math degree in Statistics from Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada in 2016. I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from the same institution after fast-tracking from the M.A.Sc in the same field. My thesis consists of creating a non-contact, non-invasive and unobtrusive patient monitoring system in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) using machine vision and deep learning techniques to estimate vital signs, detect patient movements and clinical interventions, and analyze the newborn's NICU environment to assist clinical staff in patient care.

  biography: |
    I am an electrical engineer interested in machine learning applied to sensory data. The
    main goal of my research is to develop machine learning models using sensory data related to
    biological signals such as heart rate and gait to predict the levels of stress in which a
    patient undergoes during virtual reality therapy sessions. My hobbies are mostly related 
    to outdoor activities, such as hiking, running, biking, kayaking, and skydiving.

    I am a master student in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I graduated with a degree in Biomedical and Electrical
    Engineering in June 2018. I am currently an engineering intern in the EIT (Engineer In Training) program, in pursuit
    of my P.Eng. designation. My thesis work is focused on investigating vibration levels experienced by neonatal patients
    while in transport. The aim of this research is to quantify the vibration levels babies encounter through their
    transport and eliminate them. I am interested in biomedical engineering for the purpose of changing lives and improving
    people’s health.
